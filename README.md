MWPA provides the acquisition of scientific observational data, an easy-to-use user interface for viewing, confirming and reviewing the data.
This includes the backend for data collection, the frontend and a mobile phone app for snycronization.
The recorded ones relate to mammals and their observations.

## Motivation

When I started my trip with the M.e.e.r e.V. association, I got to know the scientific work on La Gomera. It was overwhelmed to get so close to the marine mammals (adventure). I recognized the value of this work. The association M.e.e.r e.V. has dedicated itself to the promotion of environmental protection, science and education, in particular the protection of the cetaceans (whales and dolphins) and their marine habitat as well as the research of the cetaceans off La Gomera (Canary Islands). Working with the people was wonderful and important. I was asked whether we could do something and because of the old software for collecting the data. After a long time passed by the pandemic, we finally got back to the topic. I would like to take on this task on a voluntary basis to the best of my ability and time. :)

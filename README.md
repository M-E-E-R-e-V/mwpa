# MWPA - Mammal watching. Processing. Analysing.

MWPA provides the acquisition of scientific observational data, an easy-to-use user interface for viewing, confirming and reviewing the data. This includes the backend for data collection, the frontend and a mobile phone app for snycronization. The recorded ones relate to mammals and their observations. The aim is to record the observations cleanly and quickly. For this purpose, the old data is processed again and imported.

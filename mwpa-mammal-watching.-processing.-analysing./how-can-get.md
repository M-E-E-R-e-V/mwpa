# My own Installation

## Connection and communication

First of all, I would recommend contacting [M.E.E.R. e.V.](https://m-e-e-r.de/) by email, we look forward to hearing from you!

You have two options:

1. You need the app to report your sightings to the government (e.g. in Spain)
2. You want to collect the data scientifically (university, research, etc.)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are 1st, it would of course be ideal if you do both and make your data available to the researchers!
{% endhint %}

You don't need any further technical knowledge for this. Hardware and installation can be buying. [Pegenau GmbH & Co. KG ](https://www.pegenau.de/)will also be selling you with a ready-made "[Mini-Serve](https://www.pegenau.de/miniserver/)r" with the software and take care of updates and support. Simply contact us for this.

## Open Source

The software is open source and can be found on GitHub. You are invited, take a look, create a fork and update the code. All we want is that the changes remain visible to all and remain open source. Only together can we create greater added value!

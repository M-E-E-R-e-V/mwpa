# Self-hosted Installation

## Connection and communication

Firstly I would recommend contacting [M.E.E.R. e.V.](https://m-e-e-r.de/) by email we look forward to hearing from you! We are open to questions and ideas and value a good exchange of experiences.

MWPA offers two areas of application:

1. You need the app to report your sightings to the government (e.g. in Spain)
2. You want to collect the data scientifically (university, research, etc.)

{% hint style="info" %}
If the first applies to you it would of course be ideal if you do both and make your data available to the researchers!
{% endhint %}

You don't need any further technical knowledge for this. The required hardware and installation can be provided by [Pegenau GmbH & Co. KG. ](https://www.pegenau.de/)With their ready-made "[Miniserve](https://www.pegenau.de/miniserver/)r" they take care of the software updates and support. Simply contact them for this. They can also host MWPA in a cloud system.

## Open Source

The software is open source and can be found on GitHub. You are invited to take a look, create a fork and update the code. All we ask for is that the changes remain visible to everyone and stay open source. Only together can we create greater added value!

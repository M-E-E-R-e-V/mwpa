## The List

After logging in, you automatically end up on the sightings list. All synchronized sightings are displayed here, depending on the user's rights.

By clicking on the GPS location you can quickly go to the [Tour-Map](tours.md#tour-map) and see the boat's journey.

An image of the sighting can also be transmitted from the mobile app.

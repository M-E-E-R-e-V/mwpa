By clicking on the tracking points you can switch to the tour map.

## Tour-Map

By following the tour, the “start” and “end” can be changed at any time and the corresponding coordinates can be set correctly again for a sighting. In addition, the route can be created on a map using tracking. The movement of the boat and the animals can be followed.
